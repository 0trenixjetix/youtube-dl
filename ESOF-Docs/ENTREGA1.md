## Youtube-DL

### Description of the project

**Youtube-dl** is a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites. It requires the **Python** interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not platform specific, so it should work on **Linux**, **Windows** or **Mac OS X**.If you want to convert video/audio, you'll need avconv or ffmpeg. On some sites - most notably **YouTube** - videos can be retrieved in a higher quality format without sound. It will detect whether avconv/ffmpeg is present and automatically pick the best option. By default **youtube-dl** tries to download the best available quality.
Once the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as mpv, vlc or mplayer to reproduce your files.
