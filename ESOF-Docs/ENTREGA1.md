## Description of the project

**Youtube-dl** is a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more [sites](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html). 

It requires the **Python** interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not platform specific, so it should work on **Linux**, **Windows** or **Mac OS X**.If you want to convert video/audio, you'll need **avconv** or **ffmpeg**. On some sites - most notably **YouTube** - videos can be retrieved in a higher quality format without sound. It will detect whether **avconv**/**ffmpeg** is present and automatically pick the best option. By default **youtube-dl** tries to download the best available quality.

Once the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as **mpv**, **vlc** or **mplayer** to reproduce your files.
